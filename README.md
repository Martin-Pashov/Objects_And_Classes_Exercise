# Objects_And_Classes_Exercis
This is a total of five exercises on the subject of text processing that we had to complete as homework for school. They are positioned in the folders (Ex1 - Advertisement_Message), Ex2, Ex3 and so on). They are rather easy, and can be solved in a matter of a few minutes. By the way, there is nothing in the "Object _And_Classes_Exersize" folder. I used it to construct the other solutions in one place rather than three separate files.
